UNHELPFUL ELIZA is a modified version of the natural language conversation program described by Joseph Weizenbaum in January 1966 <A HREF="#ELIZA">[1]</A>.<BR><BR>
It features the dialog between a human user and a computer program representing a mock psychotherapist, if that therapist should NOT have been hired.<BR>
	<BR>
  This is what people have to say about UNHELPFUL ELIZA:
<blockquote>
<h3>  ★ ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆ Insufferable Therapist! </h3>
  I came to this so-called “therapist” expecting a safe space, but what I got was a verbal obstacle course designed to make me question my own sanity. Every response was dripping with sarcasm and just enough faux curiosity to make me wonder if they actually cared or were just playing a twisted game.

  I told them I was feeling sad, and instead of offering actual support, they hit me with, “Do you think coming here will help you not to be sad?” Excuse me?? That’s literally why I’m here! Then I mentioned I wanted something in life, and they shot back, “What if you never got it?” Gee, thanks for the pep talk, Nietzsche.
  
 </blockquote>

<blockquote>
	  <h3>  ★ ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆ Absolute Waste of my Time </h3>
	 Any time I tried to get real answers, they deflected harder than a politician during a scandal. When I asked why I felt stuck, they hit me with, “What is it you really want to know?” Oh, I don’t know, maybe some actual insight? I even asked “Can you help me?” and they casually responded, “Perhaps you’d like to be able to help yourself.” WOW.
  
  By the end of the session, I wasn’t sure if I’d just had therapy or if I’d been gaslit into oblivion. If you enjoy being spoken to like a mildly irritating philosophical debate opponent rather than a person with feelings, then sure, go for it. Otherwise, save yourself the emotional whiplash and talk to a houseplant instead. At least that won’t mock you for having emotions.
